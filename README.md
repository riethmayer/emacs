# Customization

* `M-x customize` displays the Customize interface and all the groups.
* `M-x customize-browse` opens a tree group browser. Much like the regular Customize interface but without the group descriptions
* `M-x customize-customized` customizes options and faces that you have changed but not saved. Useful if you want to tweak things.
* `M-x customize-changed` displays all options changed since a particular Emacs version. Good way to discover new features and options.
* `M-x customize-face` prompts for the name of a face to Customize. I recommend you put your point on the face you want to change. It’ll fill in the name automatically.
* `M-x customize-group` prompts for a group name (e.g., python) to Customize.
* `M-x customize-mode` customizes the major mode of your cur- rent buffer. You should do this for every major mode you use. It’s a quick way to change things and gain an overview of what your major mode can do.
* `M-x customize-saved` Displays all your saved options and faces. Extremely handy if you want to track down and disable errant changes.
* `M-x customize-themes` Shows a list of installed themes you can switch to.
